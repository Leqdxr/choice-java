# Beginners project for a choice related "game"

It consists of number challenge and coin flip.
Pressing 1 will take you to number challenge, where you have to enter a number of your choice hoping it is greater than the one computer picked.

Pressing 2 will flip a coin which will land either on heads, or tails.

Pressing any other random number would not work.
